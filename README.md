GSkel
===============================================================================
gskell is a cli project skeleton tool designed for commandline buffs and people who
generally despise using a single IDE application solution for software development.

GSkel offers one of the most prominent basic features of any IDE: templates, or
project skeletons. The main idea behind it is to have a commandline application
that can generate a new project in whatever language without creating a huge
mess of unnecessary files.
